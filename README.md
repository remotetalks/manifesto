# Problems we are trying to solve

1.How can I go to a meetup in a different city?

I cannot go to some amazing meetups, because they are far away from me. 



## Format of our remote meetup:

- Introduction of participants (5min)
- Short introduction - Speaker (3min)
- Talk (20min) - Speaker - recorded by youtube
- Questions and comments (15min)

The overall duration is about 40min, but the talk should be only 20min. We would like to watch/listen the talk during a coffee break time. :- )
